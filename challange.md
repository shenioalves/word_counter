You need to implement a XMAS search that finds words to be horizontal, vertical, diagonal, written backwards, or even overlapping other words. You don't merely need to find one instance of XMAS - you need to find all of them. Here are a few ways XMAS might appear, where irrelevant characters have been replaced with .:

..X...
.SAMX.
.A..A.
XMAS.S
.X....

The actual word search will be full of letters instead. For example:

MMMSXXMASM
MSAMXMSMSA
AMXSXMAAMM
MSAMASMSMX
XMASAMXAMM
XXAMMXXAMA
SMSMSASXSS
SAXAMASAAA
MAMMMXMMMM
MXMXAXMASX

In this word search, XMAS occurs a total of 18 times; here's the same word search again, but where letters not involved in any XMAS have been replaced with .:

....XXMAS.
.SAMXMS...
...S..A...
..A.A.MS.X
XMASAMX.MM
X.....XA.A
S.S.S.S.SS
.A.A.A.A.A
..M.M.M.MM
.X.X.XMASX

Based on the attached input file, how many times does XMAS appear? (this is the goal of the challenge)

Requirements:

- Read the file and implement the algorithm in Dart
- Use the Flutter framework to show the result in a simple UI
